# Listo

An easy to use, customizable, live recording and playback application that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. If your camera can work in Chrome it should work with this out of the box.

# Inspiration

I enjoy flying trapeze as a recreational hobby. I train at [Circus Center in San Francisco](http://circuscenter.org/).  They have a camera system that could use an upgrade so I built this to help them with it.

The word "listo" is spanish for "ready" and is a command in flying trapeze to signal to a catcher you're about to to swing.
