Scrub the TODOs in code

Srubbing

-   Backwards scrub skips gaps just like forward
-   Hitting a video error preserves scrubbing speed

Reskin the app

Tune the timeline

-   markers
-   viewport zoom
-   Save last known marker and viewport setting
-   Auto scroll

Constrain the timeline to the current day

-   Midnight switchover testing

Settings UI

-   Tune defaults
-   Camera source
-   Recording settings?
-   (nice to have) Share UX?

Thought

-   Make getting/setting the current time async and putting a lock around it?
